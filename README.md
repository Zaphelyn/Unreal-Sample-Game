# Unreal-Sample-Game

### Hello, and thank you for checking out my repo! 

This repo is a container to hold a link to my compiled Unreal Engine 5 sample game, that I built while taking a class that taught me the basics of the Unreal Editor.


### You can find a download to this game here:

Simply download and unzip it, and run the .exe in the unzipped folder. I did not do any code signing for this copy, so expect to navigate the Windows security prompts when launching this application. 


Link to the Udemy course can be found here: https://lnkd.in/e6mg_u3m



### Check out my blog post for a closer look at this course, and what it took to teach myself to use UE5!
