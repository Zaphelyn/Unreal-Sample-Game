# Unreal Engine 5 Sample Game

### Hello, and thank you for checking out my repo! 

This repo is a container to hold a link to my compiled Unreal Engine 5 sample game, that I built while taking a class that taught me the basics of the Unreal Editor.


### You can find a download to this game here:

Simply download and unzip it, and run the .exe in the unzipped folder. I did not do any code signing for this copy, so expect to navigate the Windows security prompts when launching this application. 


To run a game built with Unreal Engine 5 (UE5), you'll need a PC with at least a Windows 10 64-bit OS, a quad-core CPU (2.5 GHz or faster), 8GB of RAM, and a DirectX 11 or 12 compatible graphics card with at least 8GB of VRAM, according to Epic Games.
